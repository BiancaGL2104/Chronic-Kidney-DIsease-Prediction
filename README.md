# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Means Clustering. It includes complete data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and both classification and clustering evaluation.

> 📚 This project was developed as part of the *Machine Learning in Data Processing and Analytics* course at **Cracow University of Technology (Spring 2025)**.
